# Bike Sharing data analysis using R programming language

This project supplied daily data (bike.csv) describing bike-sharing counts from the period 1/1/2011 to 31/12/2012. The daily data includes the count of bikes shared for that day, which will be our response variable (count), information about the weather, and for each day whether it was a holiday, weekday, working day, etc. Ultimately, we wish to explain why the number of bikes shared in any day varies, and what patterns can explain how this varies. We have examined this data from the perspective of a univariate time-series (i.e. the count data) in the lab. The task here is to describe the data, model the data using both linear and decision tree models, and examine some properties of the data in terms of behavior in terms of weekday/weekend, holidays, and anomalous events. The data describes bike sharing in Washington DC.
